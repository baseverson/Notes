Redis

sudo apt-get install redis-server

Command line client: 'redis-cli'

To shutdown the database: 'redis-cli shutdown'

Data Persistence
To enable persistence (writing data to the disk), edit /etc/redis/redis.conf.
  - Find 'appendonly no' and change it to 'appendonly yes'
  - This will cause every DB action to immediately be written to disk
  - Persistent data is stored at /var/lib/redis/appendonly.aof (or whatever file is specified in the Redis conf file)
  
Network Interfaces
By default, Redis will only accept connections via the localhost (127.0.0.1) network interface. To enable access via additional interfaces, edit /etc/redis/redis.conf.
  - Find the line 'bind 127.0.0.1 ::1'
  - Change it to 'bind 127.0.0.1 <ip of additional network interface>'
