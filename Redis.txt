Redis

sudo apt-get install redis-server

Command line client: 'redis-cli'

To shutdown the database: 'redis-cli shutdown'

To enable persistence (writing data to the disk), edit /etc/redis/redis.conf.
  - Find 'appendonly no' and change it to 'appendonly yes'
  - This will cause every DB action to immediately be written to disk
  - Persistent data is stored at /var/lib/redis/appendonly.aof (or whatever file is specified in the Redis conf file)
